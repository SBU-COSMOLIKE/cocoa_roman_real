"""Unit test 19: the OpenMP race check with EuclidEmulator2 on.

Cocoa pins a modified EuclidEmulator2 (the EE2_GIT_COMMIT of
set_installation_options.sh): OpenMP threading, a 1,010-redshift
capacity, the get_boost2 API with a pre-built emulator, memory-leak
fixes, and a bilinear interpolation with a border fix (the
repository's README, external_modules/code/euclidemu2/README.md,
documents them).

The test is the race check with EE2 on: the fiducial evaluated
fresh and again as the 10th of 10 cosmologies on one model
instance, with the nonlinear P(k) from EE2 (non_linear_emul: 1).
EE2's compute is OpenMP-threaded, so leaked state or a thread race
inside it shifts the second fiducial value; the two must agree
within RACE_TOLERANCE (1e-4).

The physics gate on the modifications (the unmodified build compiled
side by side at test time and scored against the installed one) runs
as test 18 of the lsst_y1 project (its tests/data_vector/test_ee2.py);
the numbers are shared, so it is not repeated here.

To run (from the Cocoa/ folder, cocoa environment active,
start_cocoa.sh sourced):

    python -m pytest ./projects/roman_real/tests/data_vector/test_ee2.py
