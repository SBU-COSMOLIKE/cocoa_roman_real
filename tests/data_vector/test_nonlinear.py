"""Advisory checks NL1-NL2: Halofit vs EuclidEmulator2.

The likelihood can source the nonlinear matter power from CAMB's
Takahashi halofit (non_linear_emul: 2, the frozen contract's
setting) or from EuclidEmulator2 (non_linear_emul: 1). Each check
evaluates its data vector with both at ten fixed cosmologies across
the omegam/ns/As space (NONLINEAR_COMPARISON_POINTS; every other
parameter stays at the frozen fiducial) and reports, at each
cosmology, the chi2 of the Halofit vector against the EE2 vector
(delta^T C^-1 delta; the EE2 vector is that cosmology's fiducial, so
the baseline is zero by construction).

NL1. example1 (cosmic shear): the comparison under the cosmic-shear
     masked inverse covariance.
NL2. example2 (3x2pt): the same comparison on the 3x2pt likelihood,
     so the nonlinear power is also scored inside galaxy clustering
     and galaxy-galaxy lensing, under the 3x2pt covariance.

There is no pass/fail: the numbers say how much of the statistical
error budget the Halofit-vs-emulator difference consumes under the
chosen scale cuts, that is, whether Halofit can be used in a real-data
analysis with this mask. The checks read the --mask option of the
comparison sweeps (conftest.py): --mask=frozen (the default) keeps
the frozen contract's example1.mask scale cuts, --mask=ones keeps
every data point (no scale cuts).

To run (from the Cocoa/ folder, cocoa environment active,
start_cocoa.sh sourced):

    python -m pytest ./projects/roman_real/tests/data_vector/test_nonlinear.py

    python -m pytest ./projects/roman_real/tests/data_vector/test_nonlinear.py --mask=ones

On this project NL2 does not run under --mask=ones: cosmolike
rejects the all-ones covariance as not positive definite (the
README records the measurement).
